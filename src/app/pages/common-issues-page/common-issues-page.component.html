      This page is meant to <span class="blue">record common errors</span> that one may encounter, and <span class="blue">how-tos</span> of some certain things that may be tricky. <br>
      Do a "<span class="blue">ctrl + F</span>" search for a keyword in the error message you got. <br>
      <P style="font-weight: 300; color: rgb(17, 17, 50);">For example, if you're experiencing "<span class="blue">error 405: put not supported</span>", press "<span class="blue">ctrl + F</span>" and then search for the word "<span class="blue">put</span>". That would cause a search through the keywords on the error list and take you to the errors that feature that word. That way, you can find the specific error you want to read about if it's here, without doing much scrolling.</P>
